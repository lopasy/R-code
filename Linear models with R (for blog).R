Regression analysis is used for explaining or modeling the relationship between a single
variable Y, called the response, output or dependent variable; and one or more predictor,
input, independent or explanatory variables, X1,., Xp. When p=1, it is called simple
regression but when p>1 it is called multiple regression or sometimes multivariate
regression. When there is more than one Y, then it is called multivariate multiple


A regression with diastolic and test as X's and bmi as Y would have one predictor that is 
quantitative and one that is qualitative requires analysis of covariance

A regression with test as X and diastolic as Y involves just qualitative predictors requires
analysis of varianc
